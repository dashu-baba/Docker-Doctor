# Docker Host Doctor

Docker Host Doctor is a lightweight CLI that scans a Docker host and produces a prioritized health report: what’s broken (or about to break), why it matters, and what to do next. It focuses on the failures that actually take hosts down—disk/log bloat, restart loops, OOM kills, daemon/config pitfalls, and basic network conflicts.
